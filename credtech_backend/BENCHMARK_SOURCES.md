## **Methodology Notes**

1. **Sector Adjustments**: These are general benchmarks. Industry-specific thresholds may vary significantly.

2. **Geographic Scope**: Primarily US market data. International markets may have different standards.

3. **Time Period**: Based on 2020-2025 market conditions and historical analysis.

4. **Conservative Approach**: Thresholds set to reflect investment-grade quality standards used by institutional investors.

5. **Academic Validation**: All benchmarks traceable to peer-reviewed research or established industry practice.

## **Usage in Credit Scoring**

These benchmarks are used in our EBM (Explainable Boosting Machine) model to:
- Classify financial metrics into performance categories
- Generate human-readable explanations
- Provide context for credit score impacts
- Enable transparent decision-making for lending decisions

The classification directly impacts the explanatory text generation, allowing users to understand not just their score but exactly why each financial metric contributed positively or negatively to their credit rating.
